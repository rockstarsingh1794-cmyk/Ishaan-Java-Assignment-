Java Programs Using Lambda Expressions and Stream Operations
Part a: Sorting Employee Objects Using Lambda Expressions
Objective:
To develop a Java program that sorts a list of Employee objects based on fields like name, age, or salary using lambda expressions.

Explanation:
This task introduces the use of lambda expressions to simplify sorting logic:

Create an Employee class with fields: name, age, and salary.

Store multiple Employee objects in a List<Employee>.

Use Collections.sort() or List.sort() with lambda expressions to:

Sort by name (alphabetically).
Sort by age (ascending).
Sort by salary (descending or ascending).
This helps demonstrate concise and readable sorting using functional programming.
Part b: Filtering and Sorting Students Using Streams
Objective:
To create a Java program that uses lambda expressions and stream operations to filter students scoring above 75%, sort them by marks, and display their names.

Explanation:
This task highlights:

Functional-style filtering using stream().filter().
Sorting using stream().sorted().
Mapping to a specific field using map() to extract student names.
Steps:
Create a Student class with name and marks.
Use List<Student> to store data.
Filter students with marks > 75%.
Sort the filtered list by marks.
Display names using forEach() or collect().
Part c: Stream Operations on Product Dataset
Objective:
To process a large dataset of products using Java streams for grouping, finding maximum, and calculating averages.

Explanation:
This question focuses on efficient data processing using Stream and Collectors:

Create a Product class with name, price, and category.
Store the dataset in a List<Product>.
Perform the following using stream operations:
Group products by category using Collectors.groupingBy().
Find the most expensive product in each category using Collectors.maxBy().
Calculate the average price of all products using Collectors.averagingDouble().
This task demonstrates:

Efficient and readable data processing.
Aggregation and transformation using stream APIs.
Real-world usage of lambda expressions in data analytics.
